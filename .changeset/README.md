# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

# Model

Note that it is important and slightly difficult to make `Model`s that are compatible with Python uAgent `Model`s

### Known equivalents

| Python  | NPM  |
| ------- | ---- |
| Literal | Enum |

### Other Quirks
If you use `.openapi()` and chain it, the last one will override the others.
Example:
```typescript
const A = z.string().openapi({ref: "A"})
const B = z.object({
    a: A.openapi({description: "This is a ref"})
})

const model = new Model(B);
console.log(Model.dumpJson(model))
```
This will result in the ref being overriden.
Instead do this to prevent overriding:
```typescript
const A = z.string().openapi({ref: "A"})
const B = z.object({
    a: A.refine(x => true).openapi({description: "This is a ref"})
})

const model = new Model(B);
console.log(Model.dumpJson(model))
```
Refine takes in a lambda to apply any constraints. We return true to leave no change. Effectively we add a no op between the `.openapi()` calls
